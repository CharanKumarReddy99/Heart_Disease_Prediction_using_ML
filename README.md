# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_ML

Heart disease prediction using machine learning is an important advancement in the field of healthcare, aimed at improving early diagnosis and reducing the risk of fatal outcomes. By analyzing patient data, machine learning (ML) models can identify patterns and predict whether a person is at risk of developing heart disease. One of the most widely used datasets for this purpose is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes key attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and maximum heart rate. These features serve as inputs for training various ML algorithms.

Several machine learning techniques are used for heart disease prediction. Common models include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each model has its advantages. For instance, logistic regression and decision trees are simple and interpretable, while ensemble methods like random forest and XGBoost often deliver higher accuracy and robustness. The performance of these models is typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves.

The process begins with data preprocessingâ€”handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Feature selection is also important to identify which variables most influence predictions. Once the data is ready, various models are trained and tested to select the one with the best performance.

Machine learning models for heart disease prediction are increasingly used in clinical decision support systems, mobile health monitoring apps, and telemedicine platforms. They assist healthcare providers in making timely decisions and improve patient outcomes by enabling early intervention. Overall, machine learning offers a powerful and efficient way to enhance heart disease detection, contributing significantly to modern preventive healthcare.
